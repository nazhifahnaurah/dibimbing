"
" Paul Atreides is handled masterfully
"
" A masterpiece, a pillar of sci-fi/fantasy
"
" RIDICULOUS
"
" One Of The Greatest Sequel Ever Made, Dune: Part Two Was Easily The Best Films Of The Year So Far
"
" A movie of epic proportions, everything I'd hoped for.
"
" Beautiful production, less than perfect script
"
" Hard to put into words
"
" The Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back of our generation...
"
" Incredible Film
"
" Denis Villeneuve is a modern sorcerer in Sci-Fi!
"
" Spectacle
"
" A Masterpiece
"
" Absolutely stunning
"
" I wish it was better
"
" Am I the only one who's not seeing it?
"
" Enjoyed it, but not blown away
"
" A Spectacle Indeed-But Story/Characters Lag Behind Predecessor
"
" I have never done this before
"
" I have never done this before
"
" It's really good. But not convinced by some of the cast.
"
" Dont believe the hype, but dont believe the hate either...
"
" Great adaptian of the first book (but not perfect)
"
" Not as good as part one.
"
" Too much hype for this overrated sequel
"
" Truly a masterpiece
"

"
" Apologies to the cult, it's not for me; Part I was better
"
" People need to calm down, the movie is not that good
"
" Visual Effects at its best!
"
" Disappointing Compared to Part One
"
" Strong technically, weak in plot, character and dialogue
"
" Hard Not to Compare it to the Book and Feel Disappointed
"
" Quite the Experience and I say it's better then the first one.
"
" It's Part One once again, only more confused and anticlimactic
"
" Denis Villeneuve Promises and Delivers
"
" Visually stunning but missing the core of the story
"
" Enjoyable but not the masterpiece people gush about.
"
" Dune: Part Two
"
" Better than the first, even
"
" Great, but not better than Dune part 1.
"
" Deviates too far from the source material
"
" Good, but shallow
"
" It has everything you want in a dune sequel
"
" I might buy the Dune popcorn bucket...
"
" Masterclass in grand spectacle
"
" Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two is as long as it is empty
"
" Visually stunning, but emotionally flat
"
" Dune Messiah NOW!!!
"
" Editing is needed
"
" A Weakly Written Interlude for Dune Part 3.
"
" A lively experience
"
" A masterpiece in many ways and it's everything you want from a sequel!
"
" BEYOND
"
" Excellent Visuals but Overly Condensed
"
" Why not going with the book?
"
" Disappointing :(
"
" It's a cinematographic masterpiece, I hadn't come across a movie that would make me want to watch it over and over again for a long time, until today
"
" An expanded version with positivities beating its negativities

" Falls in the league of legends....
"
" Utterly Magnificent
"
" masterpiece.
"
" A masterpiece. I hope they make film adaptations for all the Dune books
"
" This is what an adaptation should be.
"
" Great, but definitely not a masterpiece.
"
" Epic storytelling on a grand scale directed by a real visionary...
"
" While things in the first part could come across as a bit long-winded, things in the second part feel a bit rushed.
"
" Lawrence Of Arrakis!
