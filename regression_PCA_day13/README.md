In this project, I will study a data set using a regression model on a house price dataset with a total of 1460 data and 80 columns.

In this project I did EDA, fire engineering, modeling using PCA and without PCA using the Logistic regression model
The best evaluation results are found in the Logistic Regression model without PCA
